            <h3>Download</h3>
            <p>To use this, make sure you have python, cv2, and flask installed on your computer.</p>
            <p>Run with python3 acidtrip.py in your command line and go to the link provided by the server.</p>
            <p>To use a new image, place it into the input folder and select it in the application.</p>

            <h3>Usage Tips</h3>
            <p>A higher amount takes longer, as well as the size of the image.</p>
            <p>If you are impatient, reduce the size of the image.</p>
            <p>The static output folder has a cache of sorts.</p>
            <p>If you want to build up a cache of a single image, using the multiple option will help with that.</p>

            <h3>Backstory</h3>
            <p>One day, I decided to work on my computer vision project that was due.</p>
            <p>The first part of the project involved writing a convolution function instead of the one provided by cv2.</p>
            <p>On my first test, I had forgotten to multiply the value in the matrix to the pixel, which blew up the image.</p>
            <p>I liked the result so much I made an application out of it.</p>
