                <p>My first character. Xavier lived in the underdark and had ties with the mafia. Being a Storm Sorcerer, he loved to use spells that dealt lightning and thunder damage. He especially loved "Ball Lightning," which was just Fireball, but lightning damage. After meeting the party, he agreed to work with them for a portion of the money. His last stand was in a volcano. After hitting a well-timed lightning bolt on two hags, the hags threw him into the lava below, causing him to perish.</p>

After one of the Gods, Kryciert, saw him doing these trades, he was turned into a horribly mangled Tiefling. During his adventures with the party, he brewed a potion which allowed him to wish for one thing. He wished to return to a human. Unfortunately, the wish was faulty, and his form became even worse than before. The party inevitably faced against Kryciert, realizing that she cursed a lot more people than just Chance. Kryciert was able to release the curse on everyone else, except for Chance. This was due to the wish he had attempted to grant himself. He left the party, as he he failed.</p>

This hypocrisy was never explored, unfortunately, since the campaign was abandoned.</p>

In 2035, after having a radioactive wall fall onto him, he seeped into the earth and was granted power from "Mother Nature". With his Boston accent in tow, Scout joined Butcher's Boys simply because his father disowned him, and he was no longer a part of high society. He secretly wishes that he could go back, but he can't. This is particularly due to Mr. Waslers abusive nature, and his newfound fear of elevators. His powers require the natural earth to be around him. It was later revealed that Scout went a club called the Garden of Eden. Rumor has it that this club deals a serum that gives other people superpowers.</p>

After getting kicked out, he met the party to help them find the various artifacts. This was to prevent the prophecy of Dugaia from being fulfilled. While the person that keeps stealing the artifacts from the party is on the loose, Lang has helped the rest of the party defeat the Adamant Conqueror and Sonorïs, the Dissonant Aftershock. Unfortunately for the party, Sonorïs still has his contingency plans that make him immortal. The Tarrasque that he unleashed has been dealt with, but the party still needs to deal with his power over the people who heard his magnum opus.

After travelling to the center of the world, transforming himself into a Turtle Dragon, and defeated the person who stole the artifacts.
