                <p>I have a standard ruleset while I play each hack. I play on set mode using no bag items during battle. I enforce level caps on my Pokémon such that they do not exceed the gym leader's ace Pokémon. I also do not use trainer documentation, but Pokémon and item documentation are allowed.</p>
                <p>While I love playing rom hacks, I also have gotten into building wacky teams. This is mostly due to my friends wanting to do tournaments.</p>
                <p>My favorite Pokémon is Flareon, followed by Serperior, Talonflame and Aurorus.</p>

                <p>Ruleset: Doubles, Level 50, all 6 Pokémon, closed team sheets.</p>
                <p>At one point, a few friends of mine decided to host a monotype tournament. I picked the Fairy type because its a good type. The team is not good objectively, but it's a funny team and thats what I wanted.</p>
                <p>Ninetales-Alola set up (or at least would attempt to set up) Aurora Veil so that my bulky Pokémon would be able to last longer on the field and Freeze Dry to have something against the Water team.</p>
                <p>Tinkaton was given a standard utility set. It was vital as it provided an immunity to Poison and had Fake Out. This was helpful during my rematch against the Water type team, when I used Fake Out on the Ogerpon-Wellspring to prevent it from using Follow Me, and getting rid of the Iron Bundle with Flutter Mane on turn 1.</p>
                <p>Azumarill was the worst Pokémon on my team by far. I overvalued Misty Terrain immensely and hoped that it could deal any sort of damage in any potential Trick Room teams. Spoiler, it didn't. Azumarill's only actual use was when the Psychic team's Gallade used Leaf Blade, giving me a chance to recover from my bad play on the first turn.</p>
                <p>Dachsbun is the underdog of the team. It was able to wall the Dragon team's Gouging Fire as it only had Outrage and Raging Fury as it's attacking moves. Dachsbun was a great partner with Sylveon as Helping Hand was able to boost Sylveon's attack power further. Body Press and Play Rough also dealt a decent chunk of damage in a lot of teams.</p>
                <p>Flutter Mane spawned a whole meme (bringing Pokémon with no STAB) in the group. Even though it had no Ghost or Fairy moves, it was able to deal significant damage because it has 135 base Special Attack plus Booster Energy. I could have used the Stellar tera type because I did not bring any off-type Pokémon, but I decided against it because I wanted to remove my ghost typing against the Ghost team.</p>
                <p>Sylveon original purpose simply never happened. I had planned to use Calm Mind, then Baton Pass the boosts to Flutter Mane so it could sweep. It ended up just becoming another damage dealer with Hyper Voice.</p>
